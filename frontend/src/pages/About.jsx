          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            The KUET Crime Management System (KUET CMS) aims to create a secure
            and transparent platform where students, faculty, and staff can
            easily report, track, and analyze incidents within the KUET campus.
            We strive to build a safer environment through efficient reporting,
            quick response, and data-driven insights.

          <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
          <p>
            Campus safety is one of the top priorities in any academic
            institution. However, the lack of a centralized system often leads
            to delays and inefficiency. Our platform bridges this gap by
            providing a simple, digital solution that connects users with
            authorities seamlessly.
